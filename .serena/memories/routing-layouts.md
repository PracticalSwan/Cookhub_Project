Routing: HashRouter with 3 layout groups. AuthLayout wraps /login and /signup; shows CookHub logo + branding panel on right (hidden on mobile). RootLayout (protected) wraps /, /search, /recipes/create, /recipes/edit/:id, /recipes/:id, /profile, /users/:userId, /recipes/my-recipes (alias to Profile with activeTab='recipes'); redirects unauthenticated to /login, admins to /admin; includes Navbar + skip-to-content link. AdminLayout guards /admin with nested routes: index -> AdminStats, /admin/users -> UserList, /admin/recipes -> AdminRecipes; redirects non-admins to / (if logged in) or /login (if not); uses fixed Sidebar + skip-to-content link. Catch-all route /* redirects to /.
