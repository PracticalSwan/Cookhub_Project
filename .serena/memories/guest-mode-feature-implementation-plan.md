## Key Technical Decisions

### State Management
- **AuthContext.jsx**: Extended with `isGuest` state
- **Storage.js**: Modified to skip metrics for guest IDs (pattern: `guest:{id}`)
- **No database records**: Guests remain client-side in localStorage only

### Guest ID Pattern
- Format: `guest-{randomId}`
- Generated by existing `storage.getOrCreateGuestId()`
- Stored in localStorage key: `cookhub_guest_id`
- Cleared on logout or browser close

### Analytics Exclusion
- `recordView()`: Skips `daily_stats.views` for guests
- `recordActiveUser()`: Skips guests
- `recordNewUser()`: Skips guests
- Search history: Stored in localStorage only (client-side)

### UI Blocking Strategy
- Disabled buttons with tooltips: "Login to {action}"
- Protected route redirects: Profile, CreateRecipe
- Clear visual indicators: "Guest" badge in Navbar
- Consistent messaging: "Login to {action}" format

## Technical Constraints

### Must NOT Change
- Existing localStorage schema (GUEST_ID key already exists)
- Current AuthContext structure (only extending)
- Storage.js API surface (modifying behavior only)
- Existing component patterns (following established conventions)

### Must Implement
- Guest mode state tracking
- Metrics exclusion for guests
- Feature blocking at UI level
- Comprehensive Playwright test coverage
- Chrome DevTools testing procedures
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests (Playwright)
- **Guest-mode.spec.js**: 15+ tests for guest entry, browsing, and blocking
- **Guest-analytics.spec.js**: 8+ tests for metrics verification
- **Guest-transitions.spec.js**: 5+ tests for state transitions

### Manual Tests (Chrome DevTools)
- localStorage inspection
- React DevTools state verification
- Network tab monitoring
- Console error checking

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- Full test suite on each browser
- Browser-specific issue documentation

## Files Affected

### Modified Files (9 files)
1. `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - State management
2. `src/lib/storage.js` - Metrics exclusion logic
3. `src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx` - Guest entry
4. `src/pages/Auth/Signup.jsx` - Guest entry
5. `src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx` - Guest status display
6. `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` - Guest menu
7. `src/pages/Recipe/RecipeDetail.jsx` - Feature blocking
8. `src/pages/Recipe/CreateRecipe.jsx` - Access blocking
9. `src/pages/Recipe/Profile.jsx` - Protected route

### Created Files (6 files)
1. `playwright.config.js` - Test configuration
2. `tests/guest-mode.spec.js` - Guest mode tests
3. `tests/guest-analytics.spec.js` - Analytics tests
4. `tests/guest-transitions.spec.js` - Transition tests
5. `docs/testing/guest-mode-devtools-checklist.md` - DevTools procedures
6. `docs/testing/guest-mode-browser-compatibility.md` - Browser matrix

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Dedicated Guest User Accounts in Database**
   - Reject: Adds DB complexity, contradicts no-metrics requirement
   - Trade-off: Persistent guest data (not desired)

2. **Continue Current Guest Tracking with Post-Hoc Filtering**
   - Reject: Would still record guest metrics in daily_stats
   - Trade-off: Additional filtering logic everywhere

3. **Separate Guest Route/Guard System**
   - Reject: Guest mode is state, not a route
   - Trade-off: Duplicate routing logic

4. **Cookies Instead of localStorage for Guest ID**
   - Reject: Cookies sent with each request (unnecessary overhead)
   - Trade-off: Size limits and expiration complexity

5. **Redux/Zustand for Guest State**
   - Reject: AuthContext already manages auth state
   - Trade-off: State sync complexity

### Chosen Approach

**Extend existing AuthContext and storage.js** - Leverages current infrastructure, maintains consistency, minimal refactoring required.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Implementation Risks

1. **AuthContext Complexity Increases**
   - Risk: State management may become harder to understand
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and incremental testing

2. **Incomplete Feature Blocking**
   - Risk: Guests might bypass blocks
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive Playwright test coverage

3. **Assumptions About User.state**
   - Risk: Components may have hardcoded logic
   - Mitigation: Code review + incremental testing

4. **localStorage Race Conditions**
   - Risk: Concurrent tabs with same guest ID
   - Mitigation: Test with multiple tabs, use unique IDs

### Technical Debt

1. **Guest Mode Conflicts with Future Backend**
   - Debt: Current changes are localStorage-based
   - Future: Document guest architecture for backend API design

2. **No Guest Account Recovery**
   - Debt: Guest history lost on browser close
   - Future: Optional guest upgrade to registered user

## Next Steps

1. **Start Implementation** with Phase 1 (TASK-001 to TASK-005)
2. **Test Incrementally** after each phase
3. **Run Playwright Suite** after Phase 6 completion
4. **Execute DevTools Checklist** after UI changes
5. **Cross-Browser Testing** before marking complete

## Memory Usage

This memory captures the complete Guest Mode Feature Implementation Plan. 

When implementing:
1. Follow `plan/feature-guest-mode-1.md` step-by-step order
2. Execute phases sequentially, not in parallel
3. Update task completion status after each task
4. Run tests before proceeding to next phase
5. Update this memory when major decisions or changes occur
