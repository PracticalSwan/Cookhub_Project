# Active Context

## Current State
Both **Guest Mode** and **Random Recipe Suggestion** features are fully implemented, verified (zero compile errors), and live-tested with Playwright browser automation (11/11 test scenarios passed).

## Recently Completed Features

### Guest Mode (all FREQ-G requirements met) — Implemented 2026-02-14
- **AuthContext**: `isGuest` state, `enterGuestMode()`, `exitGuestMode()`, guest session restoration from localStorage, DAU tracking skip, `canInteract` excludes guests, storage event sync
- **storage.js**: `recordView()` returns existing count without recording for guests, `recordActiveUser()` and `recordNewUser()` no-op for guest- prefix IDs
- **RootLayout**: Guard updated to `if (!user && !isGuest)` allowing guest browsing
- **Login.jsx & Signup.jsx**: "Continue as Guest" button with OR divider, calls `enterGuestMode()` and navigates to `/`
- **Navbar.jsx**: Guest badge with Eye icon, Login/Signup buttons instead of profile/logout for guests
- **RecipeDetail.jsx**: Guest info banner in reviews section, disabled interactions with existing `canInteract` check
- **CreateRecipe.jsx**: Guest-specific "Login Required" screen with Login/Signup CTA buttons
- **Profile.jsx**: Guest redirect with "Login to View Your Profile" message
- **RecipeCard.jsx**: Guest-specific tooltips ("Login to like", "Login to save")

### Random Recipe Suggestion — Implemented 2026-02-14
- **storage.js**: `getRandomSuggestion()` - filters published recipes, applies quality constraints (≥5 likes AND ≥1 review), falls back to any published recipe, returns null for empty
- **RecipeSuggestionModal.jsx**: New component with recipe preview (image, title, difficulty badge, likes, reviews), "View Recipe" navigates to detail, "Try Another" with loading state, empty state with ChefHat icon, image error fallback
- **Home.jsx**: "Surprise Me!" button with Sparkles icon in hero section, integrated modal with state management

## Live Testing Results (Playwright MCP) — 2026-02-14
All 11 test scenarios PASSED with zero console errors:

| # | Test | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| T1 | Guest button on Login page | PASS |
| T2 | Guest browsing home page | PASS |
| T3 | Guest navbar UI | PASS |
| T4 | Guest recipe detail view | PASS |
| T5 | Guest like/save blocked (disabled) | PASS |
| T6 | Guest create recipe blocked ("Login Required") | PASS |
| T7 | Guest profile redirect ("Login to View") | PASS |
| T8 | Guest→Login transition (state cleared, full UI) | PASS |
| T9 | Surprise Me button & modal | PASS |
| T10 | Try Another (recipe changed) | PASS |
| T11 | Console errors check (0 errors, 0 warnings) | PASS |

## Key Design Decisions
- Guest views show existing view count but do NOT increment (read-only)
- Guest session persists in localStorage until login/signup completion
- Guest ID format: `guest-{randomId}` via existing `getOrCreateGuestId()`
- `canInteract` returns false for guests (same interaction blocking as pending/suspended accounts)
- Random suggestion quality constraints: ≥5 likes AND ≥1 review, with fallback to any published recipe

## Documentation Updates (2026-02-14)

All documentation updated post-implementation and testing:
- **Serena active-context** — Rewritten with full implementation details and live testing results
- **plan/feature-guest-mode-1.md** — Status: Implemented, all tasks ✅, live testing results (8/8 guest tests + 3 bonus)
- **plan/feature-random-recipe-suggestion-1.md** — Status: Implemented, all tasks ✅, live testing results (5/5 tests)
- **plan/design-overhaul-1.md** — PREREQ-OV-001 and PREREQ-OV-002 marked ✅ Implemented with test counts

## Next Steps
- Design Overhaul (plan/design-overhaul-1.md) — currently On Hold; depends on Guest Mode + Random Recipe being completed first (PREREQ-OV-001, PREREQ-OV-002)
- Playwright automated test suites (guest-mode.spec.js, random-recipe.spec.js) — not yet created as formal test files
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
