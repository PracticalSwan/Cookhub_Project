**Key Features:**
- `isGuest` flag in AuthContext
- "Continue as Guest" buttons in Login/Signup pages
- Read-only access for guests
- Analytics bypass for guest interactions
- Guest IDs with `__GUEST__{id}` prefix
- Cross-feature integration with Random Recipe

**Testing:**
- 3 Playwright test files (guest-analytics.spec.js, guest-transitions.spec.js, guest-mode.spec.js)
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
- Chrome DevTools testing procedures

### 2. Random Recipe Suggestion ✅ Ready
**Status**: Ready for implementation after Guest Mode (Phase 2)  
**Version**: v1.1 (February 9, 2026)  
**Acceptance Criteria**: 35 ACs  
**Implementation Tasks**: 47 tasks across 6 phases  

**Key Features:**
- "Surprise Me" button in Home page hero
- RecipeSuggestionModal component
- Quality constraints (≥ 5 likes AND ≥ 1 review)
- Fallback to any published recipe
- Guest compatibility (read-only access, no analytics)
- getRandomSuggestion() function in storage.js

**Testing:**
- 12 Playwright tests including guest compatibility
- Quality constraint verification
- Randomness distribution analysis
- Image error handling tests

### 3. Design Overhaul ✅ Ready
**Status**: Blocked until both features complete (Phase 3)
**Version**: v1.4 (February 12, 2026) - Enhanced with skill patterns from frontend-design, react-development, and web-testing
**Acceptance Criteria**: 32 ACs
**Implementation Tasks**: 128 tasks across 14 phases

**Key Features:**
- Complete UI overhaul for all 13 screens
- Modern Stitch design patterns (60-30-10 color rule, design tokens)
- Hybrid color system (#C8102E + #137fec) with CSS variables
- Performance optimization (React.memo, useCallback, code splitting, custom hooks)
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility (WCAG AA compliance, 9-item checklist)
- Component enhancements (no new components)

**v1.4 Enhancements (2026-02-12):**
- **Frontend Design**: 60-30-10 color rule, design tokens CSS variables, comprehensive accessibility checklist
- **React Development**: Performance patterns (memoization, hooks, code splitting), useFormValidation/useDebounce hooks, component composition examples
- **Testing Execution**: 17-step execution order matrix (Week 1 infrastructure, Week 2 non-regression), test maintenance guidelines
- **Testing Alignment**: ~229 estimated test cases covering all testing pillars (visual, user flow, responsive, a11y, dynamic data, cross-browser, performance)

**Testing Alignment (v1.3 Update + v1.4 Enhancement):**
- Aligned with [web-testing skill](../../.copilot/skills/web-testing/) guidelines
- Added execution order matrix aligning tests with implementation phases
- Added test maintenance guidelines (baseline updates, flaky test resolution)
- Page Object Model architecture (8 Page Object classes)
- Fixtures for authentication state reuse (admin, user, guest)
- Visual regression testing (39 baseline screenshots)
- Accessibility testing via axe-core (9-item checklist from frontend-design skill)
- Responsive testing (91 checks across 7 viewports)
- Performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals with Chrome DevTools)
- Console and network error tracking patterns
- Comprehensive testing checklist (6 domains, 45+ total items)

**Integration:**
- TASK-OV-002, TASK-OV-006: "Continue as Guest" buttons preserved
- TASK-OV-034, TASK-OV-045, TASK-OV-054: Guest restrictions maintained
- TASK-OV-011, TASK-OV-018: "Surprise Me" button and RecipeSuggestionModal integrated

## Implementation Sequence Analysis

### Verified Compatibility ✅
- **No Conflicts**: All three plans complement each other perfectly
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Guest Mode → Random Recipe → Design Overhaul
- **Complete Analysis**: IMPLEMENTATION-SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS.md documents all integration points

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1**: Guest Mode (no dependencies)
2. **Phase 2**: Random Recipe (requires Guest Mode complete)
3. **Phase 3**: Design Overhaul (requires both features complete)

## Current Project State

### ✅ Foundation Complete
- All core UI components exist (Modal, Button, Card, Input, Badge, Tabs, Table)
- AuthContext with user management implemented
- Comprehensive storage.js API implemented  
- React Router with HashRouter configured
- Base authentication and recipe functionality working

### ❌ Features Not Yet Implemented
- Guest Mode (isGuest state not in AuthContext)
- Random Recipe Suggestion (no "Surprise Me" button)
- Modern UI (current design is basic, not Stitch-based)

## Testing Infrastructure

### Current Status
- Base functionality working with manual testing
- No automated testing infrastructure yet
- Playwright to be added with Guest Mode implementation

### Planned Testing Coverage
- **Guest Mode**: Comprehensive automation + cross-browser + DevTools
- **Random Recipe**: Feature tests + guest compatibility + quality verification
- **Design Overhaul**: Visual regression + responsive + accessibility + performance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Required
**Start Guest Mode Implementation:**
- No prerequisite dependencies
- Readily implementable with current codebase
- Unlocks both subsequent features
- 11-17 hours estimated effort

### Implementation Coordination
1. Execute Guest Mode implementation (Phase 1)
2. Verify Guest Mode testing completion
3. Execute Random Recipe implementation (Phase 2)  
4. Verify Random Recipe testing completion
5. Execute Design Overhaul (Phase 3)

**Project Status**: ✅ Implementation planning complete, ready for Phase 1 execution
## Memory Update (2026-02-14)

- Guest ID format in planning is guest-{randomId}.
- Planning decision: guest views are excluded from per-recipe view counts (viewedBy / getViewCount) and from daily_stats.views.
- Design Overhaul prerequisite checks now explicitly verify guest exclusion across per-recipe views, daily_stats.views, and activeUsers.
