Project: Kitchen Odyssey (branded as "CookHub" in UI). React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4. Client-only SPA with localStorage persistence (keys prefixed cookhub_). HashRouter. Roles: admin, user. User statuses: active, inactive, pending, suspended. Core features: auth (login/signup/logout), recipe CRUD with admin approval workflow, search/filter/sort, star ratings/reviews, likes/favorites, profile viewing/editing, admin dashboards (stats/users/recipes), daily stats tracking, activity logs. Guest mode: Comprehensive implementation plan (v1.2, Feb 9 2026) with 32 ACs and 48 tasks across 11 phases. Cross-feature: Random Recipe integration (guest read-only access), Playwright testing (3 test files, guest-analytics.spec.js, guest-transitions.spec.js, guest-mode.spec.js). Uses isGuest flag in AuthContext, __GUEST__{id} prefix for guest IDs, bypasses analytics (views, daily_stats, activity logs) for guest interactions. No backend API.
