AuthContext: initializes storage (seeds if empty), loads current user from localStorage, tracks loading state. login(email,pw) -> storage.login; returns {success, error}. logout -> storage.logout(userId) and clears user state. signup creates user with role:'user', status:'pending', generates id/joinedDate/favorites/viewedRecipes defaults, saves user, logs activity ("joined the platform"), calls recordNewUser for stats, then auto-logs in via storage.login. updateProfile merges updates into user and persists to both storage and currentUser. Derived flags: isAdmin (role=admin), isPending (status=pending), isSuspended (status=suspended), canInteract (user exists AND status=active AND NOT admin). Activity tracking: updateLastActive heartbeat every 1 min, recordActiveUser hourly, updates lastActive on beforeunload/pagehide. Listens for favoriteToggled to sync current user state.
