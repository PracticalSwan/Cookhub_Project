# Introduction

![Status: Implemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Implemented-brightgreen)

This implementation plan adds a dedicated Guest mode to the Recipe Sharing System, allowing users to browse recipes without creating an account. Guest mode provides read-only access equivalent to users with Pending/Suspended status but critically **does not** contribute to any analytics metrics (view counts, daily statistics, or user management dashboards).

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

### Functional Requirements

- **FREQ-G-001**: Users must be able to enter Guest mode from Login and Signup pages
- **FREQ-G-002**: Guest mode must provide read-only access to published recipes
- **FREQ-G-003**: Guests must be able to search and filter recipes
- **FREQ-G-004**: Guests must be able to view recipe details
- **FREQ-G-005**: Guest mode MUST NOT increment per-recipe view counts (`viewedBy` / `getViewCount`) and MUST NOT record guest views in daily statistics
- **FREQ-G-006**: Guest mode MUST NOT contribute to daily active user counts
- **FREQ-G-007**: Guest mode MUST NOT allow liking recipes
- **FREQ-G-008**: Guest mode MUST NOT allow favoriting recipes
- **FREQ-G-009**: Guest mode MUST NOT allow adding reviews
- **FREQ-G-010**: Guest mode MUST NOT allow creating recipes
- **FREQ-G-011**: Guest mode MUST redirect to login when accessing profile pages
- **FREQ-G-012**: Guest mode MUST NOT appear in user management dashboard
- **FREQ-G-013**: Guests must be able to switch to login/signup mode without page reload
- **FREQ-G-014**: Guest ID must persist in localStorage across page refreshes and be cleared only on explicit logout/exit or when a user logs in (localStorage does not auto-clear on browser close)
- **FREQ-G-015**: Guest mode must not record any activity in activity logs
- **FREQ-G-016**: System must gracefully handle localStorage disabled in browser with clear error message for all Guest mode operations

### Technical Constraints

- **GUEST-CON-001**: Guest mode uses localStorage only (no database records)
- **GUEST-CON-002**: Guest actions must be blocked at UI level with clear messaging
- **GUEST-CON-003**: Guest search history stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- **GUEST-CON-004**: Guest mode state must be tracked in AuthContext
- **GUEST-CON-005**: No changes required to localStorage schema (reuse existing GUEST_ID key)
- **GUEST-CON-006**: Guest mode must fail gracefully if localStorage is unavailable (disabled in browser, storage quota exceeded)
- **GUEST-CON-007**: Guest state must be synchronized across multiple tabs using storage event listeners

### Data Requirements

- **DATA-G-001**: Guests must have a unique guest ID (format: `guest-{randomId}`)
- **DATA-G-002**: Guest IDs must NOT be recorded in `daily_stats.views`
- **DATA-G-003**: Guest IDs must NOT be recorded in `daily_stats.activeUsers`
- **DATA-G-004**: Guest IDs must NOT be recorded in recipe `viewedBy` arrays

### Security Requirements

- **SEC-G-001**: Guest mode must have same access control as Pending/Suspended users
- **SEC-G-002**: Guest mode must not expose any user management features
- **SEC-G-003**: Guest mode must not expose admin endpoints or routes
- **SEC-G-004**: Guest session persists across page refreshes in localStorage and is cleared on explicit logout/exit or when a user logs in
- **SEC-G-005**: Guest mode must prevent privilege escalation to admin roles

### Testing Requirements

- **TEST-G-001**: All guest-mode interactions must be tested with Playwright
- **TEST-G-002**: Analytics verification must confirm no guest metrics recorded
- **TEST-G-003**: Cross-browser testing required (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **TEST-G-004**: Chrome DevTools testing required for localStorage inspection
- **TEST-G-005**: Mode transition testing (guest ↔ login ↔ signup)

### Guidelines & Patterns

- **GUD-G-001**: Follow existing React component structure and patterns
- **GUD-G-002**: Use existing storage.js API surface where possible
- **GUD-G-003**: Add new storage methods only when necessary for guest-specific logic
- **GUD-G-004**: Use consistent UI messaging: "Login to {action}"
- **GUD-G-005**: Guest mode should feel seamless, no jarring transitions
- **PAT-G-001**: Follow existing AuthContext provider pattern
- **PAT-G-002**: Use existing guard patterns for protected routes
- **PAT-G-003**: Reuse existing disabled button patterns for blocked features
- **PAT-G-004**: Follow Playwright test organization patterns

| T4 | Guest recipe detail view | **PASS** | Full recipe visible, guest info banner displayed, disabled like/save/review |
| T5 | Guest like/save blocked | **PASS** | All interactive buttons `[disabled]` — like, save, rating stars, review textarea, post |
| T6 | Guest create recipe blocked | **PASS** | "Login Required" screen with Login/Sign Up CTA buttons |
| T7 | Guest profile redirect | **PASS** | "Login to View Your Profile" message with Login/Sign Up buttons |
| T8 | Guest → Login transition | **PASS** | Login clears guest state, full user UI restored (Create, My Recipes, avatar, Logout) |
| T9 | Surprise Me button & modal | **PASS** | Modal opens with recipe image, title, difficulty, stats, View Recipe & Try Another |
| T10 | Try Another in modal | **PASS** | Recipe changed from "Chocolate Lava Cake" → "Chickpea Salad Wrap" |
| T11 | Console errors check | **PASS** | 0 errors, 0 warnings (only 1 verbose DOM autocomplete suggestion) |

## 3. Alternatives

### Alternative Approaches Considered During Planning Phase

- **ALT-001**: Create dedicated Guest user accounts in database
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Adds unnecessary DB complexity, contradicts no-metrics requirement
  - **Trade-off**: Would persist guest data across sessions (not desired)

- **ALT-002**: Use same guest tracking as current system but ignore in stats
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Current system records guest metrics; need to prevent recording entirely
  - **Trade-off**: Would still add to daily_stats views array, requiring filtering

- **ALT-003**: Implement Guest mode as separate route/guard system
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Guest mode is application state, not a separate route or page
  - **Trade-off**: Would create duplicate routing logic, harder to maintain

- **ALT-004**: Store guest data in cookies instead of localStorage
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: No benefit over localStorage, cookies are sent with requests (unnecessary overhead)
  - **Trade-off**: Cookies have size limits and expiration complexities

- **ALT-005**: Use Redux/Zustand for guest mode state management
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: AuthContext already manages auth state; adding another store creates complexity
  - **Trade-off**: Would require syncing between Context and external store

- **ALT-006**: Document detailed rollback procedures for guest mode deployment
  - **Decision**: REJECTED (from assessment feedback)
  - **Rationale**: Guest mode is client-side localStorage feature; rollback = clear localStorage keys
  - **Trade-off**: Simple, self-contained rollback mechanism already exists
  - **Implementation Note**: To "undo" guest mode release, clear localStorage keys (`cookhub_guest_id`, `cookhub_daily_stats` guest entries) and revert code changes via version control

- **ALT-007**: Add detailed task-level time estimates to implementation plan
  - **Decision**: DEFERRED (modified approach from assessment feedback)
  - **Rationale**: Task-level estimates unrealistic without implementation experience; phase-level ranges more accurate
  - **Trade-off**: Less granular timeline tracking but more realistic planning
  - **Implementation Note**: Added phase-level estimates (e.g., "Phase 1 (2-3 hours)") instead

- **ALT-008**: Create detailed UI mockups and wireframes for guest mode flow
  - **Decision**: DEFERRED (from assessment feedback)
  - **Rationale**: Existing UI patterns and PAT-G-004 guideline sufficient; design phase out of scope
  - **Trade-off**: No visual reference during implementation but leverages existing design system
  - **Implementation Note**: Follow existing Auth page patterns (Login.jsx, Signup.jsx) for consistency

**Chosen Approach**: Extend existing AuthContext with isGuest state, modify storage.js to skip guest metrics, update UI components to respect guest mode state. This leverages existing infrastructure and maintains consistency.

### Alternative Approaches Considered During Assessment Review

The following items were proposed during plan assessment and have been addressed:

- **ALT-009**: Run analytics verification tests earlier (after Phase 4)
  - **Decision**: MODIFIED - Keep in Phase 8 but add early verification recommendation
  - **Rationale**: Testing infrastructure in Phase 5-6 needed first, but early checks prevent late-stage issues
  - **Implementation Note**: Added "Recommended Early Verification" note to Phase 8 for post-Phase 4 analytics smoke test

**Chosen Approach**: Extend existing AuthContext with isGuest state, modify storage.js to skip guest metrics, update UI components to respect guest mode state. This leverages existing infrastructure and maintains consistency.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

The Guest Mode feature will be considered complete and ready for deployment when all of the following criteria are met:

### Functional Completeness

- **AC-001**: Users can enter Guest mode from both Login and Signup pages
- **AC-002**: Guest mode badge appears in Navbar when in guest mode
- **AC-003**: Guest users can browse all published recipes (Home, Search, RecipeDetail pages)
- **AC-004**: Guest users can search and filter recipes successfully
- **AC-005**: Like, Favorite, and Review buttons are disabled for guests with "Login to {action}" messages
- **AC-006**: CreateRecipe page shows "Login to create recipes" message for guests
- **AC-007**: Guests are redirected to Login page when accessing Profile page
- **AC-008**: Admin pages remain inaccessible to guests (blocked by existing guards)
- **AC-009**: Guests can successfully switch to Login or Signup mode without page reload
- **AC-010**: Guest state persists across page refreshes until explicit logout/exit or user login
- **AC-011**: Guest ID format follows `guest-{randomId}` pattern

### Analytics & Data Integrity

- **AC-012**: Guest recipe views do NOT increment per-recipe view counts and do NOT increment `daily_stats.views` array
- **AC-013**: Guest IDs do NOT appear in daily_stats.activeUsers array
- **AC-014**: Guest search history exists in localStorage with guest ID key
- **AC-015**: No guest-related entries appear in activity logs
- **AC-016**: Regular user views/interactions continue to be tracked normally (no regression)

### Testing & Quality

- **AC-017**: All Playwright automated tests pass (guest-mode.spec.js, guest-analytics.spec.js, guest-transitions.spec.js)
- **AC-018**: Test teardown function successfully clears localStorage between test runs
- **AC-019**: Manual DevTools checklist completed with all checkboxes verified
- **AC-020**: Cross-browser testing completed successfully (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **AC-021**: Multiple tab synchronization works correctly (storage events trigger updates)
- **AC-022**: No console errors or warnings when transitioning between modes

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **AC-023**: System handles localStorage disabled with clear error message
- **AC-024**: Guest mode entry fails gracefully if localStorage quota exceeded
- **AC-025**: Guests accessing protected URLs directly are redirected to Login
- **AC-026**: No race conditions or state inconsistencies with multiple tabs open in guest mode

### Integration & Compatibility

- **AC-027**: Existing AuthContext functionality remains unchanged (backward compatibility)
- **AC-028**: storage.js API surface remains backward compatible for existing code
- **AC-029**: Guest mode works correctly with all existing UI components
- **AC-030**: Visual design matches existing UI patterns (no jarring transitions)

### Cross-Feature Compatibility

- **AC-031**: Guest users can use Random Recipe "Surprise Me" feature in read-only mode (view suggestions, navigate to recipe detail)
- **AC-032**: Guest usage of "Surprise Me" does NOT increment recipe view counts or analytics

## 8. Risks & Assumptions

### Implementation Risks

- **RISK-001**: AuthContext state management complexity may increase with isGuest flag
  - **Mitigation**: Keep guest logic simple and well-documented
  - **Impact**: Medium - Manageable with clear state transitions

- **RISK-002**: Incomplete feature blocking may allow guests to interact
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive Playwright test coverage for all interactive elements
  - **Impact**: High - Security and data integrity concern

- **RISK-003**: Existing components may have hardcoded assumptions about user.state
  - **Mitigation**: Code review and incremental testing after each component update
  - **Impact**: Medium - May require unexpected refactoring

- **RISK-004**: localStorage key conflicts or race conditions in concurrent tabs
  - **Mitigation**: Implemented storage event listener for tab synchronization (TASK-046), test with multiple tabs open, use unique guest IDs
  - **Impact**: Low - Addressed with synchronization mechanism


- **RISK-005**: Playwright tests may be flaky due to timing issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use explicit waits and assertions, retry failed tests
  - **Impact**: Low - Common testing challenge, manageable

- **RISK-006**: localStorage may be disabled or quota exceeded in certain browsers/user settings
  - **Mitigation**: Implement try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages (FREQ-G-016), graceful degradation
  - **Impact**: Low - Edge case handled with proper error messaging

### Assumptions

- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Existing AuthContext structure can be extended without breaking changes
  - **Validation**: Review AuthContext.jsx before implementation
  - **Impact**: Medium - Core change, requires careful analysis

- **ASSUMPTION-002**: storage.js current `recordView()` logic can be modified without breaking existing functionality
  - **Validation**: Check current implementation and test logged-in user views after changes
  - **Impact**: Low - Should be backward compatible

- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Users have modern browsers supporting ES6+ JavaScript
  - **Validation**: Browser compatibility testing in Phase 11
  - **Impact**: Low - Project already targets modern browsers

- **ASSUMPTION-004**: No additional localStorage schema changes required
  - **Validation**: Confirm existing GUEST_ID key works for session management
  - **Impact**: Low - Reusing existing infrastructure

- **ASSUMPTION-005**: Playwright test environment can be configured for Vite dev server
  - **Validation**: Setup test environment early in Phase 5
  - **Impact**: Medium - Testing infrastructure dependency

- **ASSUMPTION-006**: Future backend migration will respect guest mode constraints
  - **Validation**: Document guest mode requirements for future database migration
  - **Impact**: Medium - Technical debt for future work

- **ASSUMPTION-007**: No existing guest analytics data needs to be preserved
  - **Validation**: Current system tracks guests, but requirement is to remove those metrics
  - **Impact**: Low - Breaking change, matches project requirements

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **DEBT-001**: Guest mode state in AuthContext may conflict with future backend integration
  - **Remediation**: Document guest mode architecture for backend API design
  - **Effort**: Small (1-2 hours documentation)

- **DEBT-002**: localStorage-based guest tracking will need to be replaced with backend session management
  - **Remediation**: Plan guest session handling in future API endpoints
  - **Effort**: Medium (backend API design task)

- **DEBT-003**: No guest account recovery or persistent guest history (by design)
  - **Remediation**: Future feature: optional guest account upgrade to registered user
  - **Effort**: Large (backend + database + UI changes)

### Future Implementation Notes

When implementing backend API integration (future work), the following guest mode constraints must be respected:

1. **No guest records in database** - Guests remain client-side only
2. **No guest contributions to metrics** - Backend must filter out guest IDs from analytics
3. **Guest search history** - Keep client-side in localStorage, do not persist to database
4. **Guest authentication** - Use session tokens but mark as guest type for permissions check
5. **Guest role permissions** - Treat as "pending" status for all access control checks
