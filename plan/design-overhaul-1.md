# Introduction

![Status: On Hold](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-On%20Hold-orange)

This implementation plan provides a complete design overhaul for the Kitchen Odyssey Recipe Sharing System, transforming the current UI to match modern Google Stitch designs while preserving all existing functionality, logic, and features. The overhaul updates all major screens (13 total) with improved visual hierarchy, modern component patterns, responsive layouts, and enhanced accessibility, ensuring seamless integration with Guest Mode and Random Recipe Suggestion features.

**Testing Methodology Update (v1.3):** All testing sections in this plan are now aligned with Playwright best practices for a Vite + React app. Testing implementation follows established patterns for:
- Page Object Model (POM) architecture with reusable page classes
- Fixtures for authentication state reuse (admin, user, guest)
- Global setup for saving auth states to storage files
- Playwright test structure with beforeEach/afterEach hooks and test.step()
- Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Accessibility testing via @axe-core/playwright for WCAG AA compliance
- Chrome DevTools integration for performance profiling and debugging
- Comprehensive testing checklist covering functionality, responsive, cross-browser, accessibility, performance, and error handling

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

### Functional Requirements

- **FREQ-OV-001**: All 13 screens from Stitch project must be implemented in new design
- **FREQ-OV-002**: No hardcoded data values in the UI (counts, names, images, metrics) - all data must come from:
  - `src/lib/storage.js` for recipe data, user data, metrics, search history, activity logs
  - `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` for user authentication state (user, isGuest, canInteract)
  - Dynamic component props for data-bound values
  - Conditional rendering based on real data states (no mocked UI for any screen)
  - Static labels are allowed when not derived from data
  - Test with varied data sets (empty, 1 item, 100 items) during implementation
  - VIOLATION: Any hardcoded recipe names, user counts, or fixed data in JSX will fail tests
- **FREQ-OV-003**: All existing functionality must be preserved and connected to new design
- **FREQ-OV-004**: Guest mode functionality must be fully integrated (isGuest state, guest badges, restricted states)
- **FREQ-OV-005**: Random recipe suggestion must be integrated ("Surprise Me" button, RecipeSuggestionModal)
- **FREQ-OV-006**: All authentication flows (login, signup, guest mode) must work in new design
- **FREQ-OV-007**: Recipe management (create, edit, delete) must work in new design
- **FREQ-OV-008**: Search and filtering functionality must be preserved
- **FREQ-OV-009**: Admin dashboard and management tables must remain functional
- **FREQ-OV-010**: User profile with tabs must work in new design
- **FREQ-OV-011**: Responsive design must work across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **FREQ-OV-012**: All interactive features (like, favorite, review) must work with new design
- **FREQ-OV-013**: Restricted states (pending, suspended, guest) must be clearly communicated
- **FREQ-OV-014**: Empty states must be handled gracefully with Stitch-inspired designs
- **FREQ-OV-015**: Loading states must provide visual feedback
- **FREQ-OV-016**: Error states must be handled with user-friendly messages
- **FREQ-OV-017**: Guest usage of Random Recipe Suggestion must not increment any view metrics (FREQ-RS-000-1, FREQ-RS-000-2, AC-RS-033)
  - per-recipe view counts (`viewedBy` / `getViewCount`) must not include guest views
  - `daily_stats.views` must not contain guest ID entries
  - `activeUsers` array must not contain guest IDs
  - Verifies complete guest analytics bypass across Random Recipe feature

### Technical Constraints

- **CON-OV-001**: No new base UI components; reuse existing primitives (Modal, Button, Card, Input, Badge, Tabs, Table). Feature-specific components are allowed only when they compose existing UI components
- **CON-OV-002**: Use hybrid color system blending brand identity (#C8102E) with Stitch modern accent (#137fec) — see detailed DESIG-OV-002 below
- **CON-OV-003**: Maintain existing routing (HashRouter) and navigation patterns
- **CON-OV-004**: Preserve existing AuthContext state management (user, isGuest, canInteract)
- **CON-OV-005**: Maintain existing storage.js API surface (all data operations)
- **CON-OV-006**: Follow existing React patterns (hooks, callbacks, event listeners)
- **CON-OV-007**: Avoid hardcoded copy when it should come from data; static UI labels are acceptable
- **CON-OV-008**: Maintain existing layout components (Navbar, Sidebar, AuthLayout, AdminLayout)
- **CON-OV-009**: Preserve all event-driven updates (favoriteToggled, recipeUpdated, etc.)

### Design Constraints

- **DESIG-OV-001**: Match Stitch design patterns (card-based layouts, ample whitespace, clear typography)
- **DESIG-OV-002**: Maintain hybrid color system respecting both Kitchen Odyssey's cooking theme (#C8102E) and Stitch's modern aesthetic (#137fec):
  - **Primary Navigation & Brand Identity:** Use #C8102E (existing brand wine red) for:
    - Navbar logo and primary navigation links
    - Primary CTA buttons (Create Recipe, Save, etc.)
    - Hero section gradients (blending #C8102E → #137fec)
    - Brand-identity elements requiring strong visual connection
  - **Modern Accent & Interactive Highlights:** Use #137fec (Stitch blue/teal) for:
    - Secondary buttons and link states
    - Hover states on primary buttons
    - Active tabs and indicator pills
    - Focus rings and outline states
    - Status badges (green/red/yellow) with warm gray text
    - Card border hover effects (opacity 0.1-0.2)
    - Active section indicators in navigation
  - **Text & Background:** Maintain warm gray/cool-gray scales from existing design for:
    - Primary text (dark gray/black)
    - Secondary text (medium gray)
    - Placeholder and disabled states (light gray)
    - Surface backgrounds (white/off-white)
  - **Color Contrast Requirements:** Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA standards:
    - Primary text on light backgrounds: 4.5:1 minimum
    - Large text on colored backgrounds: 3:1 minimum
    - Verify with contrast checker during implementation (TASK-OV-099)
  - **Implementation Note:** This hybrid approach preserves Kitchen Odyssey's established cooking theme while adopting Stitch's modern, polished aesthetic

**60-30-10 Rule Application:**
- **60% - Primary Surfaces**: Cool/neutral backgrounds (#f5f7fa, #ffffff) - page backgrounds, card surfaces
- **30% - Secondary Elements**: Secondary colors and borders (#e5e7eb, #6b7280) - borders, secondary text, muted elements
- **10% - Brand Accents**: #C8102E (primary) + #137fec (secondary) - CTAs, navigation, interactive highlights

**Design Tokens Implementation:**
```css
/* src/styles/design-tokens.css */
:root {
  /* 60% - Primary Surfaces */
  --color-primary-bg: #f5f7fa;
  --color-primary-surface: #ffffff;
  --color-primary-text: #334155;
  
  /* 30% - Secondary Elements */
  --color-secondary-border: #e5e7eb;
  --color-secondary-text: #6b7280;
  --color-secondary-muted: #94a3b8;
  
  /* 10% - Brand Accents */
  --color-brand-primary: #C8102E;
  --color-brand-secondary: #137fec;
  --color-success: #22c55e;
  --color-warning: #f59e0b;
  --color-error: #ef4444;
  
  /* Spacing Scale */
  --spacing-sm: 16px;   /* 4 */
  --spacing-md: 24px;   /* 6 */
  --spacing-lg: 32px;   /* 8 */
  --spacing-xl: 48px;   /* 12 */
  --spacing-2xl: 64px; /* 16 */
  
  /* Border Radius */
  --radius-md: 8px;
  
  /* Transitions */
  --transition-fast: 150ms;
  --transition-base: 200ms;
  --transition-slow: 300ms;
}
```
- **DESIG-OV-002.1**: Use consistent 8px border radius for all components matching Stitch's "ROUND_EIGHT" setting:
  - All buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary): 8px border radius
  - All cards (recipe cards, user cards, form cards): 8px border radius
  - All inputs (text inputs, selects, textareas): 8px border radius
  - All modals: 8px border radius
  - Small badges/tags: 4-6px border radius (slightly smaller pill shape)
  - This consistency is critical for polished, cohesive appearance across all 13 screens
- **DESIG-OV-002.2**: Use "Work Sans" font family as specified in Stitch design theme:
  - Import Work Sans from Google Fonts (add to public/index.html or index.html)
  - Apply as primary font family across all pages and components
  - Use weight scale consistently: 300 (light), 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)
  - This replaces or supplements existing font choices to match Stitch typography exactly
- **DESIG-OV-003**: Maintain visual hierarchy from Stitch (headings > subheadings > body text) with specific font weights and sizes:
  - H1 (Page Titles): 32-40px, weight 700 (bold), line-height 1.1-1.2
  - H2 (Card/Section Titles): 20-24px, weight 600 (semi-bold), line-height 1.2-1.3
  - H3 (Tab Labels/Form Sections): 16-18px, weight 500-600, line-height 1.3-1.4
  - Body (Content): 14-16px, weight 400 (regular), line-height 1.5-1.6
  - Small (Metadata): 12-14px, weight 300-400, line-height 1.3-1.4
- **DESIG-OV-004**: Use Tailwind responsive breakpoints for grid systems with exact breakpoint values:
  - **Mobile (< 640px):** 1 column grid for all content using Tailwind's default (no breakpoint prefix)
  - **Small tablet (640px-768px):** 2 column grid using `sm:` prefix for cards and sections
  - **Large tablet (768px-1024px):** 2-3 column grid using `md:` and `lg:` prefixes
  - **Desktop (1024px-1280px):** 4 column grid using `xl:` prefix
  - **Large desktop (> 1280px):** 5 column grid for hero/featured sections using `2xl:` prefix
  - All responsive classes must use Tailwind's consistent breakpoint prefixes (no custom breakpoints)
- **DESIG-OV-005**: Implement consistent spacing using Tailwind spacing scale with exact pixel mappings:
  - **4 (16px):** Small gaps between related items — card grid gaps, form field spacing, padding inside containers
  - **6 (24px):** Medium gaps (between sections) — spacing between content sections, sidebar-to-content spacing
  - **8 (32px):** Large gaps (between major containers) — major page sections, wrapper padding
  - **12 (48px):** Very large gaps (page margins) — page margins, padding between top-level sections
  - **16 (64px):** Extra large gaps (hero sections) — hero section padding, prominent visual breaks
  - Use these exact Tailwind scale values (no custom spacing values) for consistency
- **DESIG-OV-006**: Interactive elements must have hover states and transitions (0.2-0.3s duration using Tailwind transition utilities)
- **DESIG-OV-007**: Use color-coded status indicators (green for active, yellow for pending, red for suspended)
- **DESIG-OV-008**: Modal overlays must have backdrop blur and fade-in animations
- **DESIG-OV-009**: Tables must have sticky headers, sortable columns, responsive overflow
- **DESIG-OV-010**: Images must have aspect ratio preservation and skeleton loaders
- **DESIG-OV-011**: Forms must have client-side validation with clear error messages

### Accessibility Requirements

- **A11Y-OV-001**: All interactive elements must have proper ARIA labels
- **A11Y-OV-002**: Focus management must be implemented (focus trapping in modals)
- **A11Y-OV-003**: Keyboard navigation must work (Tab, Enter, ESC keys)
- **A11Y-OV-004**: Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
- **A11Y-OV-005**: Screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
- **A11Y-OV-006**: Focus visible state must be clearly indicated

### Testing Requirements

- **TEST-OV-001**: Manual testing of all 13 screens to ensure design matches Stitch
- **TEST-OV-002**: Test all existing functionality with new design (no regressions)
- **TEST-OV-003**: Responsive testing on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
- **TEST-OV-004**: Accessibility testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **TEST-OV-005**: Test guest mode integration across all screens (badge visibility, restricted states, and no guest view-count increments)
- **TEST-OV-006**: Test random recipe suggestion integration (button, modal, loading states)
- **TEST-OV-007**: Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **TEST-OV-008**: Verify no hardcoded values (test with different data sets) - Supported by automated tests (TASK-OV-121)
- **TEST-OV-009**: Verify all existing events (favoriteToggled, recipeUpdated) still fire correctly - Supported by automated tests (TASK-OV-123)
- **TEST-OV-010**: Run automated Playwright test suite - Execute all automated tests (TASK-OV-114 through TASK-OV-128) to ensure no regressions
- **TEST-OV-011**: Verify visual regression tests pass - Ensure no unintended layout/visual changes across 13 screens
- **TEST-OV-012**: Review performance metrics against baselines - Ensure Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID, TTI) remain acceptable

### Guidelines & Patterns

- **GUD-OV-001**: Follow Stitch design patterns identified from screen screenshots
- **GUD-OV-002**: Maintain existing component structure and naming conventions
- **GUD-OV-003**: Use existing state management patterns (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **GUD-OV-004**: Reuse existing validation patterns from forms
- **GUD-OV-005**: Follow existing routing patterns (useNavigate, useParams)
- **GUD-OV-006**: Use existing event dispatching patterns (window.dispatchEvent)
- **GUD-OV-007**: Maintain existing layout patterns (Navbar fixed top, Sidebar fixed left for admin)
- **GUD-OV-008**: Follow existing animation patterns (animate-page-in, transitions)
- **PAT-OV-001**: Reuse existing Modal component wrapper pattern for all modals
- **PAT-OV-002**: Follow existing Card component structure for recipe/user cards
- **PAT-OV-003**: Use existing Badge component for status indicators
- **PAT-OV-004**: Follow existing Table component pattern for admin tables
- **PAT-OV-005**: Use existing Tabs component for multi-panel interfaces
- **PAT-OV-006**: Use existing cn() utility for className merging

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Prerequisite: Complete Existing Features

**CRITICAL**: This design overhaul plan MUST be executed AFTER both existing feature plans are complete:

- **PREREQ-OV-001**: ✅ Complete [feature-guest-mode-1.md](./feature-guest-mode-1.md) implementation
  - Adds isGuest state to AuthContext
  - Adds "Continue as Guest" button to Login/Signup pages
  - Implements guest mode functionality (read-only browsing, no metrics)
  - Status: ✅ **Implemented** (2026-02-14) — Live-tested with Playwright MCP (8/8 tests passed)

- **PREREQ-OV-002**: ✅ Complete [feature-random-recipe-suggestion-1.md](./feature-random-recipe-suggestion-1.md) implementation
  - Adds "Surprise Me" button to Home page
  - Adds RecipeSuggestionModal component
  - Implements random recipe suggestion with quality constraints
  - Status: ✅ **Implemented** (2026-02-14) — Live-tested with Playwright MCP (3/3 tests passed)

**Implementation Order Analysis**: Guest Mode and Random Recipe features are compatible and must be completed before the Design Overhaul to avoid rework. This order prevents integration conflicts and ensures all new states are represented in the redesigned screens.

**Rationale**: Both features add components, state, and functionality that the new design must display and respect. Implementing design overhaul first would require significant revisions to account for these features.

**useFormValidation Hook Pattern (per react-development skill):**
```javascript
// src/hooks/useFormValidation.js
function useFormValidation(initialValues, validationSchema) {
  const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues)
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({})
  const [touched, setTouched] = useState({})

  const handleChange = useCallback((name, value) => {
    setValues(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }))
    
    // Real-time validation on change
    if (touched[name]) {
      validateField(name, value)
    }
  }, [touched, validationSchema])

  const handleBlur = useCallback((name) => {
    setTouched(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: true }))
    validateField(name, values[name])
  }, [values, validationSchema])

  const validateField = useCallback((name, value) => {
    const error = validationSchema[name]?.(value)
    setErrors(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: error || null }))
  }, [validationSchema])

  return { values, errors, touched, handleChange, handleBlur }
}

// Usage in CreateRecipe.jsx
const { values, errors, touched, handleChange, handleBlur } = useFormValidation(
  { title: '', description: '', ingredients: [] },
  {
    title: value => value.length === 0 ? 'Title is required' : null,
    description: value => value.length < 10 ? 'Description must be at least 10 characters' : null,
  }
)

// Error UI
<Input
  label="Title"
  value={values.title}
  onChange={value => handleChange('title', value)}
  onBlur={() => handleBlur('title')}
  error={touched.title && errors.title}
  helperText="Enter a descriptive title for your recipe"
/>
```

**useDebounce Hook Pattern:**
```javascript
// src/hooks/useDebounce.js
function useDebounce(value, delay = 500) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value)
    }, delay)

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler)
    }
  }, [value, delay])

  return debouncedValue
}

// Usage in Search.jsx
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('')
const debouncedSearchQuery = useDebounce(searchQuery, 500)

useEffect(() => {
  // API call only happens 500ms after user stops typing
  if (debouncedSearchQuery) {
    searchRecipes(debouncedSearchQuery)
  }
}, [debouncedSearchQuery])
```

**Component Composition Patterns (per react-development skill):**

**Button Component Composition:**
```javascript
// src/components/ui/Button.jsx
export function Button({ variant, size, children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn(
        'inline-flex items-center justify-center',
        variantClasses[variant],
        sizeClasses[size]
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

// Usage with icon composition
<Button variant="primary">
  <Icon name="CheckCircle" />
  <span>Save Recipe</span>
</Button>

// Icon-only variant
<Button variant="icon" aria-label="Like">
  <Icon name="Heart" />
</Button>
```

**Card Component Composition:**
```javascript
// src/components/ui/Card.jsx
export function Card({ children, image, badges, footer }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm overflow-hidden">
      {image && (
        <div className="relative">
          <img src={image} alt="" className="w-full" />
          {badges && <div className="absolute top-2 right-2">{badges}</div>}
        </div>
      )}
      <div className="p-4">{children}</div>
      {footer && <div className="border-t p-4">{footer}</div>}
    </div>
  )
}

// Usage in RecipeCard
<Card
  image={recipe.image}
  badges={<Badge variant="sm">{recipe.difficulty}</Badge>}
  footer={<RecipeActions recipe={recipe} />}
>
  <h3>{recipe.title}</h3>
  <p>{recipe.description}</p>
</Card>
```

### Implementation Phase 9: Component Library Enhancements (Estimated: 4-5 hours)

- GOAL-009: Enhance existing UI components to support new design requirements without creating new components

### Performance Optimization Guidelines (per react-development skill)

**Memoization Strategy:**
- **TASK-OV-073 (Card)**: Wrap RecipeCard in React.memo when receiving large recipe arrays
- **TASK-OV-075 (Button)**: Memoize onClick handlers with useCallback in parent components
- **TASK-OV-078 (Table)**: Implement virtualization for tables with >50 rows (consider react-window or react-virtualized)

**Custom Hooks Reuse:**
- Create `useDebounce` hook for search input (500ms delay)
- Create `useLocalStorage` hook for localStorage operations (memoized)
- Create `useMediaQuery` hook for responsive breakpoints

**Code Splitting:**
- Lazy load RecipeCard with React.lazy() for initial page load optimization
- Lazy load Modal components with dynamic import
- Reduce initial JS bundle size through Vite code splitting

**Component Priority Order:**
Execute component enhancements in the following order to maximize efficiency and minimize blocking:

1. **P0 (Critical - Blocks Core Functionality):** Must complete first
   - TASK-OV-076: Modal enhancements (used by 13/13 screens)
   - TASK-OV-074: Input enhancements (used by 4/13 screens: auth pages, profile, create/edit forms)
   - TASK-OV-075: Button enhancements (used by all screens)

2. **P1 (High Impact - Major Design Fidelity):** Complete after P0
   - TASK-OV-073: Card enhancements (used by 8/13 screens: home, search, profile, admin user list, etc.)
   - TASK-OV-078: Table enhancements (used by 2/13 screens: admin recipes, admin users)

3. **P2 (Medium - Advanced Features):** Complete after P1
   - TASK-OV-077: Tabs enhancements (used by 2/13 screens: recipe detail, profile)

4. **P3 (Low - Nice-to-Have):** Complete last
   - TASK-OV-079: Badge enhancements (nice-to-have for status badges)

**Test Maintenance Guidelines:**

**Visual Regression Baseline Updates:**
- Baseline screenshots should be updated only when intentional design changes are made
- Update process: Run tests → Identify changed screenshots → Review each diff → Update baselines if changes are intentional
- Exclude dynamic content from screenshot comparison: dates, timestamps, user-specific IDs

**Flaky Test Resolution:**
- **Timing Issues**: Use waitForSelector() instead of fixed timeouts, increase wait times as needed
- **State Conflicts**: Ensure test cleanup in afterEach resets localStorage and application state between tests
- **Race Conditions**: Use waitForResponse() for API calls before asserting results
- **Viewport Issues**: Specific viewport tests should use consistent viewport size, no dynamic resizing in same test
- **Test Failure Analysis:**
  - When test fails, review console errors, network logs, and trace files
  - Use Playwright Inspector (npx playwright test --debug) for interactive debugging
  - Tag tests with @flaky if consistently failing, investigate root cause
  - Document known flaky tests in test directory README with investigation status

**Automated Testing Strategy (Based on Playwright testing guidelines):**

#### Test Organization
- **Page Object Model**: Page Objects in `tests/pages/*.js` - encapsulate selectors and interactions
- **Fixtures**: Custom fixtures in `tests/fixtures.js` for auth reuse, test data, cleanup
- **Global Setup**: `tests/global-setup.js` saves auth states (admin, user, guest) to avoid repeated login
- **Test Files**: Organized by feature (`tests/login.spec.js`, `tests/recipe-create.spec.js`, etc.)

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Visual Regression Testing:**
- Compare screenshots across all pages to detect layout shifts or unintended design changes
- Use pixel difference thresholds (TASK-OV-117)
- Capture baselines for 13 screens x 3 viewports = 39 baseline screenshots
- Run on every PR/TASK-OV-126 via CI/CD pipeline

**User Flow Testing (Following Page Object Model pattern):**
- Verify critical paths work end-to-end with Page Objects (TASK-OV-118)
- 8 critical paths:
  - Authentication paths: login, signup, guest mode, logout (4 tests)
  - Recipe management: create, edit, delete (2 tests)
  - Admin operations: approve user, approve recipe (2 tests)
- Each test follows structure: beforeEach -> test.steps -> cleanup in afterEach

**Responsive Testing (pattern in this plan):**
- Viewport array: Mobile (375px, 414px), Tablet (768px, 1024px), Desktop (1280px, 1440px, 1920px)
- Test all 13 screens at each viewport (TASK-OV-119)
- Check navigation accessibility on mobile (hamburger menu vs. desktop nav)
- Verify no horizontal scrollbars (except tables)
- Total checks: 13 screens x ~7 viewports = 91 responsive checks

**Accessibility Testing (pattern in this plan):**
- Use axe-core via Playwright (@axe-core/playwright) (TASK-OV-120)
- Test all 13 screens for WCAG AA violations
- Check areas per this checklist:
  - All interactive elements keyboard accessible
  - Focus states visible (2px ring)
  - ARIA labels on icon-only buttons
  - Form fields have labels or aria-label
  - Images have alt text (except decorative)
  - Touch targets ≥ 44x44px on mobile

**Dynamic Data Testing (Test for hardcoded values):**
- Test 5 data scenarios per this plan (TASK-OV-121):
  - Empty state (no recipes, no users)
  - Single item (1 recipe, 1 user)
  - Moderate data (10 recipes, 10 users)
  - Bulk data (100 recipes, 100 users)
  - Edge cases (invalid data, very long text)
- Verify UI scales, no hardcoded names/counts visible
- Prevents FAIL-OV-002 violations

**Guest Mode Testing:**
- Verify guest badge visibility in navbar (TASK-OV-122)
- Test restricted states on all 8 pages (disabled buttons, "Login to {action}" messages)
- Verify Profile redirects to login for guest users
- Verify metrics not tracked in localStorage
- **CRITICAL**: Verify guest usage of "Surprise Me" button does NOT increment view metrics (FREQ-RS-000-1, FREQ-RS-000-2, AC-RS-033)
  - per-recipe view counts (`viewedBy` / `getViewCount`) must not include guest IDs
  - `daily_stats.views` must not contain guest ID entries
  - `activeUsers` array must not contain guest IDs

**Event System Testing:**
- Verify favoriteToggled event fires on like/unlike (TASK-OV-123)
- Verify recipeUpdated event fires on create/edit/delete
- Ensure listening components (Home, Search, Profile) update state immediately
- Test with all user types (admin, user, pending, guest)

**Performance Monitoring (Chrome DevTools pattern in this plan):**
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance API (TASK-OV-124)
- Capture Core Web Vitals baselines: LCP, CLS, FID, TTI (TASK-OV-125)
- Compare against thresholds per this checklist:
  - Page load time < 3 seconds
  - LCP < 2.5 seconds
  - CLS < 0.1
  - No layout shifts on interaction
  - Images optimized

**Cross-Browser Testing:**
- Test on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (TASK-OV-100 through TASK-OV-103)
- Verify identical behavior across browsers
- Check event listeners work (favoriteToggled, recipeUpdated)
- Verify flexbox/grid layouts match Chrome

**Continuous Integration (Following CI pattern from e2e example):**
- GitHub Actions workflow (TASK-OV-126)
- Run full test suite on every PR
- Parallelize tests across workers
- Fail PR if any test fails
- Upload test artifacts (screenshots, traces, coverage)

**Test Coverage Targets (Updated):**
- Visual regression: 13 screens × 3 viewports = 39 baseline screenshots
- User flow tests: 8 critical paths with Page Objects
- Accessibility tests: 13 screens with axe-core assertions
- Responsive tests: 13 screens × 7 viewports = 91 responsive checks
- Dynamic data tests: 5 data scenarios × 8 critical screens = 40 data validation tests
- Cross-browser tests: 3 browsers × 8 critical paths = 24 cross-browser checks
- Performance tests: Core Web Vitals for all 13 screens

**Total Estimated Tests:** ~229 test cases covering all testing patterns in this plan

## 3. Alternatives

### Alternative Approaches Considered

- **ALT-OV-001**: Create new design system from scratch with custom components
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Violates CON-OV-001 (no new base UI components); existing components work and maintain consistency
  - **Trade-off**: More flexibility vs. more development time and potential inconsistencies

- **ALT-OV-002**: Use external component library (Material UI, Ant Design, etc.)
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Project has established component patterns; external libs add bundle size, bloat, learning curve
  - **Trade-off**: Faster development vs. increased bundle size, less control

- **ALT-OV-003**: Implement design overhaul feature-by-feature incrementally
  - **Decision**: CONSIDERED (partial approval)
  - **Rationale**: Could reduce risk, but user requested "complete overhaul" in one phase
  - **Trade-off**: Smaller, manageable chunks vs. disjointed design during transition
  - **Implementation Note**: Phases in this plan allow granular testing while maintaining design consistency

- **ALT-OV-004**: Preserve current design and only add Stitch screens as new pages
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: User requested "overhaul" of current design; mixing old and new creates inconsistency
  - **Trade-off**: Less risk vs. poor UX, confusion, maintenance burden

- **ALT-OV-005**: Implement design overhaul before guest mode and random recipe features
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Both features add components/state that new design must support
  - **Trade-off**: Start overhaul sooner vs. risk of breaking changes when features added
  - **Implementation Note**: PREREQ-OV-001 and PREREQ-OV-002 enforce correct order

- **ALT-OV-006**: Use Stitch-generated HTML/CSS directly without React conversion
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Would create unmaintainable code, lose event listeners, state management, functionality
  - **Trade-off**: Fast implementation vs. unmaintainable codebase, broken functionality

**Chosen Approach**: Comprehensive design overhaul in single implementation plan, executed AFTER guest mode and random recipe features are complete. Reuse existing components with enhancements. Maintain full functionality. Follow Stitch design patterns. This balances design quality, development time, maintainability, and feature integration.

## 6. Web Testing Methodology

This section defines comprehensive testing methodology for this plan. The testing approach for design overhaul integrates:

### Testing Pillars
1. **Playwright Automation** - Browser-based end-to-end testing
2. **Chrome DevTools Integration** - Performance profiling, console/network monitoring
3. **Accessibility Testing** - axe-core integration for WCAG compliance
4. **Visual Regression** - Screenshot comparison to prevent design drift
5. **Responsive Testing** - Multi-viewport validation (mobile, tablet, desktop)
6. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Chromium, Firefox, WebKit compatibility

### Test Architecture Patterns

#### Page Object Model (POM)
All tests must use the Page Object Model pattern described below:

```js
// Example: LoginPage.js
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page
    this.emailInput = page.getByLabel('Email')
    this.passwordInput = page.getByLabel('Password')
    this.submitButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' })
    this.errorAlert = page.getByRole('alert')
    this.guestButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: /guest/i })
  }

  async goto() { await this.page.goto('/login') }

  async login(email, password) {
    await this.emailInput.fill(email)
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password)
    await this.submitButton.click()
  }
}
```

**Required Page Objects:**
- `tests/pages/AuthPage.js` - Login/Signup pages
- `tests/pages/HomePage.js` - Home with hero, search, grid
- `tests/pages/SearchPage.js` - Search with filters, results
- `tests/pages/RecipeDetailPage.js` - Recipe detail with tabs (Ingredients, Instructions, Reviews)
- `tests/pages/CreateRecipePage.js` - Create form with dynamic lists
- `tests/pages/ProfilePage.js` - Profile with tabs (My Recipes, Favorites, Activity, Settings)
- `tests/pages/AdminStatsPage.js` - Admin dashboard overview
- `tests/pages/AdminRecipesPage.js` - Recipe management table
- `tests/pages/UserListPage.js` - User management table

#### Fixtures and Authentication Reuse
Use custom fixtures for authentication state reuse (avoids logging in for every test):

```js
// fixtures.js
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test'
import { AuthPage } from './pages/AuthPage'
import { HomePage } from './pages/HomePage'

export const test = base.extend({
  authPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const authPage = new AuthPage(page)
    await use(authPage)
  },
  homePage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const homePage = new HomePage(page)
    await use(homePage)
  },
  authenticatedAsUser: async ({ page }, use) => {
    // Reuse storage state from global-setup
    await use({ page, user: { email: 'user@test.com', role: 'user' } })
  },
})
export { expect } from '@playwright/test'
```

#### Global Setup for Auth States
Create auth state files for each user type:

```js
// global-setup.js
import { chromium } from '@playwright/test'

async function globalSetup() {
  const states = [
    { file: '.auth/admin.json', email: 'admin@test.com', password: 'admin123', path: '/admin' },
    { file: '.auth/user.json', email: 'user@test.com', password: 'user123', path: '/' },
    { file: '.auth/guest.json', loginAsGuest: true, path: '/' },
  ]
  // Save auth state for each user type
}
export default globalSetup
```

#### Test Structure Best Practices
All test files must follow this structure:

```js
test.describe('Recipe Management', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/recipes')
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')
  })

  test.afterEach(async ({ page, context }) => {
    // Cleanup: delete test data via API
    await page.request.delete('/api/test/cleanup')
    // Check console errors
    const errors = await page.evaluate(() => window._consoleErrors || [])
    expect(errors.length).toBe(0)
  })

  test('creates a recipe', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('Navigate to create form', async () => {
      await page.goto('/recipes/create')
    })

    await test.step('Fill recipe fields', async () => {
      await page.getByLabel('Title').fill('Test Recipe')
      await page.getByLabel('Description').fill('Test description')
    })

    await test.step('Submit form', async () => {
      await page.getByRole('button', { name: /create|submit/i }).click()
    })

    await test.step('Verify success', async () => {
      await expect(page.getByText(/created|saved|success/i)).toBeVisible()
      await expect(page).toHaveURL('/recipes/1')
    })
  })
})
```

## 7. Testing Implementation Guide

### Automated Testing Setup (Phase 14)

- GOAL-014: Implement comprehensive Playwright test suite with Page Objects, fixtures, Chrome DevTools, and CI/CD integration

## 8. Error Handling & Debugging

### Console Monitoring Strategy

- **TEST-OV-ERROR-001**: Console Error Tracking
  - Monitor console errors during all Playwright tests via `page.on('console')` listener
  - Categorize errors:
    - JavaScript errors (TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError)
    - Warnings (deprecation warnings, ignored promises)
    - Info messages (analytics beacons, etc.)
  - Fail tests if any JavaScript errors occur (unless explicitly ignored)
  - Log warnings to review (deprecations indicate future breaking changes)
  - Use Chrome DevTools Console tab for manual debugging (filter by error/warning levels)

- **TEST-OV-ERROR-002**: Network Request Monitoring
  - Monitor all network requests via `page.on('request')` and `page.on('response')`
  - Track failed requests (status >= 400 or status === 0)
  - Verify no 404s for static assets (images, CSS, JS files)
  - Verify no 500s for API calls (indicate server errors)
  - Check slow requests (> 3 seconds) using `page.on('responsefinished')` timing data
  - Verify API response codes correct (200 OK for GET/POST, 201 Created, 204 No Content, etc.)
  - Use Chrome DevTools Network tab for manual debugging (filter by status code, response time)

- **TEST-OV-ERROR-003**: JavaScript Exception Handling
  - Capture unhandled promise rejections via `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')`
  - Capture global errors via `window.addEventListener('error')`
  - Verify React error boundaries catch component errors gracefully
  - Verify error boundaries show user-friendly error messages (not React stack traces in production)
  - Test error boundary triggers:
    - Intentional null reference in component
    - Intentional undefined property access
    - Intentional failed promise in useEffect
  - Verify crash recovery (user can navigate away, retry action, reload page)

- **TEST-OV-ERROR-004**: User-Friendly Error Messages
  - Verify all error messages are human-readable (not technical stack traces)
  - Verify error messages include actionable next steps ("Try again", "Contact support", etc.)
  - Verify form validation errors appear below affected inputs (not in modal alert)
  - Verify API error messages show what went wrong (e.g., "Email already in use" vs. generic error)
  - Verify guest users see helpful messages ("Login to like" vs. "Access denied")
  - Verify empty states show friendly messages ("No recipes found. Try adjusting filters" vs. blank screen)

- **TEST-OV-ERROR-005**: Network Error Handling
  - Verify offline handling with Service Worker (if implemented)
  - Verify slow network handling (use Chrome DevTools Network Throttling: Slow 3G)
  - Verify failed API requests show error to user with retry option
  - Verify timeout handling for long requests (> 10 seconds)
  - Optimize image loading (check for unnecessary large requests via Network tab)
  - Verify no race conditions from duplicate API calls

## 9. Performance Monitoring (Chrome DevTools pattern)

### Core Web Vitals Baselines

- **TEST-OV-PERF-001**: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) (TASK-OV-125)
  - Measure LCP for all 13 screens (within 2.5 seconds threshold per this checklist)
  - Identify slow LCP culprits via Chrome DevTools Performance tab LCP marker
  - Optimize LCP by:
    - Lazy loading below-fold images
    - Preloading critical CSS/fonts
    - Optimizing image formats (WebP, appropriate sizes)
  - Set LCP performance budget at 2.5 seconds for all pages

- **TEST-OV-PERF-002**: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) (TASK-OV-125)
  - Measure CLS for all 13 screens (within 0.1 threshold per this checklist)
  - Identify layout shift culprits via Chrome DevTools Performance tab Layout Shift markers
  - Fix layout shifts by:
    - Reserving image space with aspect-ratio CSS
    - Avoiding dynamic content insertion without reserved space
    - Using transform animations (won't trigger layout shift)
  - Set CLS performance budget at 0.1 for all pages

- **TEST-OV-PERF-003**: First Input Delay (FID) (TASK-OV-125)
- Measure FID for interactive elements (target < 100ms though this plan doesn't specify a strict threshold)
  - Identify long tasks blocking main thread via Chrome DevTools Performance tab Long Tasks
  - Optimize FID by:
    - Code splitting large JS bundles
    - Debouncing event handlers if expensive
    - Using React.lazy() for route components
  - Verify no JavaScript tasks > 50ms block user input

- **TEST-OV-PERF-004**: Time to Interactive (TTI) (TASK-OV-125)
  - Measure TTI for all 13 screens (target < 5 seconds per this checklist: page load < 3 seconds)
  - Identify JavaScript execution blocking interactivity via Performance tab
  - Optimize TTI by:
    - Reducing initial JS bundle size (tree-shaking, code splitting)
    - Deferring non-critical JS (analytics, social widgets)
    - Using React.lazy for non-critical UI and memoizing heavy components
  - Set TTI performance budget at 5 seconds for all pages

- **TEST-OV-PERF-005**: Bundle Size Monitoring
  - Measure production bundle sizes for each route (goal: < 100KB JS per route)
- Use a bundle analyzer (e.g., rollup-plugin-visualizer) to generate a bundle report
  - Identify largest dependencies contributing to bundle size
  - Optimize by:
    - Using dynamic imports for heavy libraries (charts, PDF generator)
    - Replacing large libraries with lighter alternatives
    - Implementing tree-shaking to remove unused code
  - Verify no duplicate dependencies

- **TEST-OV-PERF-006**: Rendering Performance
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to profile render cycles
  - Identify forced reflows and unnecessary repaints
  - Verify unnecessary re-renders avoided (React DevTools Profiler)
  - Test with 100 recipes in grid to ensure rendering scales:
    - Virtualized long lists if needed (react-window or react-virtualized)
    - Pagination or infinite scroll if rendering > 50 items
  - Verify animations are GPU-accelerated (use transform/opacity, not left/top)

  - **Mitigation**: Test components individually (TASK-OV-080) before full integration; maintain backward compatibility
  - **Impact**: Medium - Could break existing uses elsewhere in codebase

- **RISK-OV-003**: Guest mode and random recipe features may not be complete, blocking design overhaul
  - **Mitigation**: PREREQ-OV-001 and PREREQ-OV-002 enforce correct order; verify features complete before starting
  - **Impact**: High - Would cause significant rework or incomplete design

- **RISK-OV-004**: Stitch designs may not perfectly align with existing component patterns
  - **Mitigation**: Enhance components gradually as needed; compromise on minor design differences if necessary
  - **Impact**: Medium - Could affect design fidelity or require more component changes

- **RISK-OV-005**: Responsive design across 13 screens is complex and time-consuming
  - **Mitigation**: Use consistent breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px) and Tailwind responsive utilities
  - **Impact**: Low - Manageable with systematic approach, phases 10 and 11 address this

- **RISK-OV-006**: Cross-browser differences (Firefox vs. Chrome vs. Safari) may cause layout issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use standard CSS properties; vendor prefixes if needed; thorough cross-browser testing (Phase 12)
  - **Impact**: Low - Common challenge, phased testing catches issues

- **RISK-OV-007**: Overhaul touches major files (13 pages, 6 layouts, 9 components) - git conflicts possible
  - **Mitigation**: Work on isolated phases; commit frequently; use feature branches if needed
  - **Impact**: Medium - Git workflow best practices mitigate this

- **RISK-OV-008**: Hardcoded values may accidentally slip into new UI code
  - **Mitigation**: Code review specifically for hardcoded strings/numbers; systematic testing (TASK-OV-113)
  - **Impact**: Medium - Violates user requirement; testing catches this

- **RISK-OV-009**: Guest mode restrictions may not be obvious or clear in new design
  - **Mitigation**: Use clear messaging ("Login to {action}") and visual badges; test with guest users
  - **Impact**: Low - Usability issue, testing catches this

- **RISK-OV-010**: Performance regression from more complex UI renderings
  - **Mitigation**: Use React.memo for expensive components; lazy loading for heavy components; monitor bundle size
  - **Impact**: Low - Optimization opportunities exist; Vite handles bundling well
- **RISK-OV-011**: Flaky automated tests (visual regression, timing issues)
  - **Mitigation**: Use wait strategies (waitForSelector, waitForResponse), implement retry logic, use consistent viewports
  - **Impact**: Medium - False positives in CI/CD, requires test maintenance
- **RISK-OV-012**: Playwright/DevTools integration affects test reliability or performance
  - **Mitigation**: Test integration in isolation, monitor memory usage, use minimal DevTools features
  - **Impact**: Low - Playwright supports Chrome DevTools well; has patterns for common use cases
- **RISK-OV-013**: Continuous integration resource costs or timeout issues
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize test parallelization, implement efficient test caching, set reasonable timeouts
  - **Impact**: Low - GitHub Actions and similar CI platforms handle Playwright efficiently
- **RISK-OV-014**: Visual regression tests require frequent baseline updates (false positives from minor changes)
  - **Mitigation**: Use pixel difference thresholds, exclude dynamic content (dates, timestamps) from screenshot comparison
  - **Impact**: Medium - Test maintenance overhead; automated tests reduce manual testing burden

### Assumptions

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-001**: Both prerequisite features (guest mode, random recipe) will be complete before this plan starts
  - **Validation**: Check status of both plans; verify all tasks marked Completed
  - **Impact**: High - Blocking dependency; must enforce execution order

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-002**: Stitch screenshots show complete designs for all screens
  - **Validation**: Reference screenshots for each screen; assume hidden interactions follow standard patterns
  - **Impact**: Medium - May need inference for some interactions

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-003**: Existing components can be enhanced to support new design needs without major rewrites
  - **Validation**: Review component code; assess enhancement feasibility during implementation of TASK-OV-073 through TASK-OV-079
  - **Impact**: Medium - If infeasible, may need to revisit "no new components" constraint

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-004**: Tailwind v4 supports all CSS properties needed for Stitch designs
  - **Validation**: Review Tailwind v4 documentation; test during implementation
  - **Impact**: Low - Tailwind is expressive; any gaps can use custom CSS

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-005**: storage.js API remains stable (no breaking changes expected)
  - **Validation**: Review storage.js functions; ensure no breaking changes in guest mode/random recipe plans
  - **Impact**: Low - Unlikely; if changes occur, update references here

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-006**: CSS Grid and Flexbox support in target browsers is complete
  - **Validation**: Browser support targets: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+, Safari 14+
  - **Impact**: Low - All major browsers support these features

- **ASSUMPTION-OV-007**: User's browser supports ES6+ and modern JS features

  - **Impact**: Low - Project requirements align with modern web standards
- **ASSUMPTION-OV-008**: Playwright supports all testing requirements (a11y, performance, Chrome DevTools)
  - **Validation**: Playwright documentation confirms axe-core integration, Chrome DevTools Protocol support
  - **Impact**: Low - Playwright actively maintained; supports all required features
- **ASSUMPTION-OV-009**: CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) supports Playwright and parallel test execution
  - **Validation**: Review CI platform documentation; confirm Playwright runner compatibility
  - **Impact**: Low - Major CI platforms support Playwright well; fallback: run locally on push
- **ASSUMPTION-OV-010**: Team has access to modern browsers for local test development
  - **Validation**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+ for cross-browser manual testing
  - **Impact**: Low - Automated tests run Chromium, manual testing covers others

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **DEBT-OV-001**: Component files may become large with enhancement props/options
  - **Remediation**: Split into smaller components or hooks for complex logic
  - **Effort**: Medium (refactoring during maintenance)

- **DEBT-OV-002**: Visual regression baselines will need periodic updates
  - **Remediation**: Document baseline update procedure and use pixel-diff thresholds
  - **Effort**: Medium

- **DEBT-OV-003**: Design system lacks documentation (spacing scale, component usage)
  - **Remediation**: Create a lightweight design system guide (or Storybook later)
  - **Effort**: Medium

- **DEBT-OV-004**: No internationalization (i18n) support
  - **Remediation**: Plan translation keys and extraction for user-facing text
  - **Effort**: Large

- **DEBT-OV-005**: Automated accessibility monitoring is not continuous
  - **Remediation**: Add CI reporting/dashboard for a11y results
  - **Effort**: Medium

- **DEBT-OV-006**: Performance monitoring is lab-only (DevTools)
  - **Remediation**: Add RUM analytics in production if needed
  - **Effort**: Medium

- **DEBT-OV-007**: Cross-browser testing is manual
  - **Remediation**: Add automated cross-browser runs in CI (BrowserStack/Sauce Labs)
  - **Effort**: Large

- **DEBT-OV-008**: Edge-case data coverage is limited
  - **Remediation**: Add data generators for long text, unicode, and large lists
  - **Effort**: Small

### Future Enhancement Notes

When considering post-overhaul enhancements or iterations:

1. **Design System Documentation**: Create component library documentation (Storybook) for consistency
2. **Visual Regression Tests**: ✅ Implemented via Playwright (TASK-OV-117) - Expand with more complex scenarios
3. **Automated Accessibility Testing**: ✅ Implemented via axe-core + Playwright (TASK-OV-120) - Add continuous monitoring dashboard
4. **Internationalization**: Add translation support for global users
5. **Theme Support**: Add dark/light mode toggle (popular feature request)
6. **Progressive Web App**: Convert to PWA for offline support and installability
7. **Performance Monitoring**: ✅ Implemented via Chrome DevTools (TASK-OV-125) - Add analytics SDK for production monitoring
8. **A/B Testing**: Test design variants using existing analytics infrastructure
9. **E2E Test Expansion**: Add more complex user flows (e.g., guest → signup → create recipe)
10. **Test Coverage Dashboard**: Create visualization of test results, coverage, and pass/fail trends over time

**Critical Reminder**: This design overhaul plan MUST NOT be started until BOTH feature-guest-mode-1.md and feature-random-recipe-suggestion-1.md have status: 'Completed'. Executing this plan prematurely would require significant rework to account for the components, state, and functionality those plans introduce.

**IMPORTANT: NO IMPLEMENTATION YET** - This plan document is for future execution after prerequisites are met. All changes described here are for a future UI overhaul from current design to new Stitch UI. No code should be implemented now.
