# Introduction

![Status: Implemented](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Implemented-brightgreen)

This implementation plan adds a random recipe suggestion feature to the Recipe Sharing System. When users click "Surprise Me", the system recommends a random recipe that meets quality criteria (at least 5 likes and 1 review). If no recipes match these constraints, the system falls back to suggesting any published recipe. The suggestion is presented in a modal with options to view the recipe or try again.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

### Functional Requirements

- **FREQ-RS-000**: Feature must work for guest users (no blocking, same behavior as pending/suspended users)
- **FREQ-RS-000-1**: Guest views in Random Recipe feature must NOT increment per-recipe view counts (`viewedBy` / `getViewCount`)

### Live Testing Results (Playwright MCP Browser Automation) — 2026-02-14

Implementation Phases 1–3 were live-tested using Playwright MCP browser automation tools against the running Vite dev server. The Random Recipe Suggestion feature was tested both as a logged-in user and as a guest user.

| # | Test Scenario | Result | Verification Details |
|---|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| T9 | Surprise Me button & modal | **PASS** | Modal opens with recipe image, title, difficulty badge, like/review counts, View Recipe & Try Another buttons |
| T10 | Try Another in modal | **PASS** | Recipe changed from "Chocolate Lava Cake" (Hard, 1 like) → "Chickpea Salad Wrap" (Easy, 2 likes) |
| T9-guest | Surprise Me (guest mode) | **PASS** | Button visible and functional in guest mode (tested during T2 verification) |
| View Recipe nav | View Recipe button | **PASS** | Navigated correctly to `/#/recipes/recipe-10` (Chickpea Salad Wrap detail page) |
| Console | Console errors check | **PASS** | 0 errors, 0 warnings across all interactions |

## 3. Alternatives

### Alternative Approaches Considered

- **ALT-RS-001**: Create dedicated /surprise route and page instead of modal
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Modal provides better UX, no page reload needed, faster interaction
  - **Trade-off**: Simpler routing vs. better user experience

- **ALT-RS-002**: Store last suggestion in localStorage
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: No persistence needed; user can always click "Try Again"
  - **Trade-off**: Would add complexity without clear user benefit

- **ALT-RS-003**: Show recipe suggestions randomly in home grid interspersed
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Intentional action ("Surprise Me") is better than passive suggestions
  - **Trade-off**: Less discoverable but more user-controlled

- **ALT-RS-004**: Filter by user preferences (cookinglevel, favorite categories)
  - **Decision**: DEFERRED for future enhancement
  - **Rationale**: Out of scope for initial feature; personalization better as follow-up
  - **Trade-off**: Less personalized vs. simpler initial implementation

- **ALT-RS-005**: Create separate suggestion logic with algorithm (smart recommendations)
  - **Decision**: REJECTED
  - **Rationale**: Random selection meets requirements; smart recommendations require more infrastructure
  - **Trade-off**: Simpler vs. more sophisticated matching

- **ALT-RS-006**: Use server-side random generation (when backend is added)
  - **Decision**: REJECTED for client-side version
  - **Rationale**: Project is currently client-only; server-side optimization unnecessary
  - **Trade-off**: Less scalable vs. matches current architecture

**Chosen Approach**: Add getRandomSuggestion function to storage.js, create RecipeSuggestionModal component, integrate button into Home.jsx hero, use existing UI components and patterns. This provides feature richness with minimal architectural changes.

   - Verify modal opens with suggestion

3. **Phase 4 - 5**: Styling and Testing (TASK-020 to TASK-035)
   - Execute all test suites in order:
     - Functional testing first (TASK-026 to TASK-030)
     - Modal interaction testing (TASK-031, TASK-032)
     - User role testing (TASK-033) — includes Guest User (TEST-RS-ROLE-005)
     - Responsive design testing (TASK-034)
     - Visual & styling testing (TASK-020 to TASK-025)
     - Accessibility testing (TASK-035)

   - Run automated tests: modal open/close, "Try Another", navigation
   - Run guest mode E2E tests (requires Guest Mode feature completed first)
   - Run accessibility and responsive automated tests
   - Verify all tests pass consistently (3+ runs)

## 8. Risks & Assumptions

### Implementation Risks

- **RISK-RS-001**: getRandomSuggestion may return same recipe multiple times in a row (random nature)
  - **Mitigation**: Document this as expected behavior; users can click "Try Another"
  - **Impact**: Low - Users control randomness via interaction

- **RISK-RS-002**: Modal state management may cause memory leaks if not cleaned up properly
  - **Mitigation**: Use useEffect cleanup to reset state on unmount (TASK-019)
  - **Impact**: Medium - Could cause performance degradation or stale state issues

- **RISK-RS-003**: Recipe image loading may cause layout shift in modal
  - **Mitigation**: Set fixed aspect ratio or use skeleton loader (TASK-022)
  - **Impact**: Low - Visual quality issue, not functional

- **RISK-RS-004**: getReviews(recipeId) may be expensive if called for all recipes during filtering
  - **Mitigation**: For client-side localStorage, this is acceptable; would optimize for backend later
  - **Impact**: Low - Acceptable performance for current architecture

- **RISK-RS-005**: User may click "View Recipe" and "Try Another" rapidly causing race conditions
  - **Mitigation**: Implement request ID or cancellation token to ensure only one suggestion request at a time, plus loading state to disable buttons (TASK-008, TASK-032)
  - **Impact**: Low - Request tracking prevents concurrent requests

- **RISK-RS-006**: Empty recipe list may cause modal to display poorly without proper handling
  - **Mitigation**: Implement explicit empty state message and UI (TASK-009, TEST-RS-FUNC-003)
  - **Impact**: Medium - Poor UX if not handled, but explicit task covers this

- **RISK-RS-007**: Existing storage.js functions may break with new getRandomSuggestion function
  - **Mitigation**: Review existing function signatures and patterns before implementation (TASK-001)
  - **Impact**: Medium - Could cause regressions in existing features
  - **Validation**: Run existing tests/manual checks after TASK-004

- **RISK-RS-008**: Modal component may not support the specific layout needed for suggestions
  - **Mitigation**: Review Modal component API and existing usage patterns (TASK-005)
  - **Impact**: Low - Reuse existing component; fallback to custom modal if needed

### Assumptions

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-001**: Existing Modal component supports closing via ESC, backdrop, and X button programmatically
  - **Validation**: Review Modal.jsx implementation before TASK-010
  - **Impact**: Low - Standard modal pattern; verify during implementation

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-002**: getReviews(recipeId) returns an array (possibly empty) and accepts recipe ID parameter
  - **Validation**: Review storage.js getReviews implementation before TASK-001
  - **Impact**: Medium - Core logic for constraint checking

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-003**: Recipe model always has likedBy array (may be empty but not null/undefined)
  - **Validation**: Review seed data and recipe creation code; implement safe navigation anyway (CON-RS-007)
  - **Impact**: Low - Handled with safe navigation (likedBy?.length || 0)

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-004**: Home.jsx has hero section with search bar that can accommodate additional buttons
  - **Validation**: Review Home.jsx structure before TASK-014
  - **Impact**: Low - Can add button if hero section doesn't exist

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-005**: Test data includes recipes with various like counts and review counts for testing
  - **Validation**: Check seed data in storage.js; create test data if needed
  - **Impact**: Low - Can create test data during testing phase

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-006**: useNavigate from react-router-dom is available in Home.jsx
  - **Validation**: Check existing imports in Home.jsx
  - **Impact**: Low - Standard routing; add import if missing

- **ASSUMPTION-RS-007**: Image URLs in recipes are valid and load reliably
  - **Validation**: Test with existing recipe images during TASK-022, TASK-025
  - **Impact**: Low - Implement error handling for broken images (AC-RS-018)

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **DEBT-RS-001**: Client-side filtering is O(n) for all recipes; scales poorly with large recipe counts (> 1000)
  - **Remediation**: When backend is added, move filtering logic to server-side with database indexing
  - **Effort**: Medium (backend optimization, not urgent for current scale)

- **DEBT-RS-002**: No algorithm-based personalization (only random selection)
  - **Remediation**: Future enhancement: ML-based recommendations, user preferences, collaborative filtering
  - **Effort**: Large (requires data analysis, ML infrastructure, user tracking)

- **DEBT-RS-003**: Randomness not truly cryptographically secure (Math.random() sufficient for this use case)
  - **Remediation**: If fairness becomes critical (contests, rewards), use crypto.getRandomValues()
  - **Effort**: Small (library change, not needed for current use case)

- **DEBT-RS-004**: getReviews called for each recipe during filtering (inefficient)
  - **Remediation**: Cache review counts in recipe model or optimize with batch fetching when backend added
  - **Effort**: Medium (schema change or optimization)

- **DEBT-RS-005**: No analytics tracking for suggestion feature (acceptance rate, repeat usage)
  - **Remediation**: Add event tracking for suggestion clicks, "View Recipe" clicks, "Try Another" clicks
  - **Effort**: Small (add storage calls to record suggestion analytics)

### Implementation Notes

- **Guest Mode Compatibility**: Random Recipe respects Guest Mode analytics blocking (AC-RS-033) - guests can use "Surprise Me" but recipe views don't increment per-recipe view counts or `daily_stats.views`
- **Design Overhaul Compatibility**: RecipeSuggestionModal and "Surprise Me" button are integrated into Design Overhaul (design-overhaul-1.md) through:
  - TASK-OV-011: "Surprise Me" button preserved in new hero design
  - TASK-OV-018: RecipeSuggestionModal integrated into new Home page design
  - PREREQ-OV-002: Random Recipe must be completed before Design Overhaul
- **Implementation Order**: Implement Guest Mode first, then Random Recipe Suggestion, then Design Overhaul to avoid rework and keep UI states aligned

### Future Enhancement Notes

When implementing backend or advanced features, consider:

1. **Server-side randomization**: Use database's RANDOM() or equivalent function for better performance
2. **Personalized recommendations**: Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or ML models
3. **A/B testing**: Test different suggestion algorithms (random vs. personalized vs. trending)
4. **Suggestion analytics**: Track suggestion acceptance rate, time-to-view, repeat usage metrics
5. **Exclusion filters**: Allow users to exclude recipes they've already viewed or don't like
6. **Category-specific suggestions**: Add "Surprise Me with Breakfast", "Surprise Me Desserts", etc.
7. **Seasonal recommendations**: Feature seasonal recipes during holidays or special events
8. **Trending suggestions**: Combine random selection with trending/popular recipes boost
