## Architecture

The system uses a client-side storage approach with localStorage, making it lightweight and suitable for demonstration and development purposes.

**User Workflow:**
1. Registration creates an account with "Pending" status
2. Admin reviews and activates user accounts
3. Contributors submit recipes for admin approval
4. Active users can view, like, review, and favorite published recipes

**User Roles:**
- **Admins** - Platform oversight, user activation, recipe approval, analytics
- **Contributors** (Active Users) - Full platform access, create recipes, engage with content
- **Guest/Pending** - Browse recipes while awaiting admin approval
- **Guest Mode Users** - Browse without account (read-only, no analytics tracking)
